Two Uses BT and Algorithm Addresses

BT - back translation

"write original algorithms and arguments"
https://github.com/luciangreen/listprologinterpreter/blob/master/lpiverify4.pl
%% Two Uses - original argument and algorithm (file)
Test 25
BT: Splits on a new line and returns the number of duplicate lines.

"identify different writers"
https://github.com/luciangreen/listprologinterpreter/blob/master/philosophy/he%20should%20identify%20different%20writers%20in%20the%20exposition.pl
original, white (e.g. author), black (e.g. character), found white, found black and found purple (neither white nor black) lists of names
BT: Finds set A minus set B, set A minus set C and set A minus the conjunction of set B and set C.

"Ethically assess"
https://github.com/luciangreen/listprologinterpreter/blob/master/lpiverify4.pl
%% Two Uses - PhD algorithm - agree with all of only one of two sides and give opinion
Test 23
BT: Tests whether all items in set A are members of set B and not members of set C or all items in set A are members of set C and not members of set B.
Test 24
BT: Finds a member of a pair of values which has a certain value as the first value and returns the second value.
